# C2-stats-bot

Discord bot that displays Cultris II stats.

### TODO (or ideas) list

- database backups
- Command that finds a player in all leaderboards
- Delete old logging
- FFA Notification system
- in `/online` : if all players in a room are afk, these players wont be displayed
- in `/stats`, `/legacystats`, `/challenges`, `/online`: Interaction fails when website is down.  Send a message to user warning them of this
- 'news' every week
- Persistent view, showing online players. Maybe sending notifications to a role when player count is higher than a certain number
- 95% stats: stats removing the worst 5% of them (or 2.5% worst and 2.5% best), to account for games with low stats due to rare mistakes, or opponent's mistake ending player's game too soon
