# C2-stats-bot

Discord bot that displays Cultris II stats.

### TODO list

- database backups
- Command that finds a player in all leaderboards
- Delete old logging
- FFA Notification system
- in `/online` : if all players in a room are afk, these players wont be displayed
- in `/stats` : Maybe last hour stats?- in `/stats`, `/legacystats`, `/challenges`, `/online`: Interaction fails when website is down.  Send a message to user warning them of this
- 'news' every week
